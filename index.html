      <p>I'm a <strong>Mathematician</strong>, <strong>software developer</strong>, and <strong>teacher</strong>.  Currently I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.okstate.edu/">Oklahoma State University</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h3>

<p>I got my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2012 under the supervision of John Luecke.   I am currently working on several projects</p>

<ul>
  <li>giving bounds on the bridge numbers of certain families of knots,</li>
  <li>constructing knots with prescribed bridge numbers and interesting Dehn surgeries, </li>
  <li>examining the relationship between the bridge numbers of a knot and properties of the knot exterior, such as its Heegaard structure, and</li>
  <li>developing and applying methods in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>

<p>For much of the past decade I have been involved in teaching at the college level.  Classes I've taught include college algebra, precalculus, calculus 1, 2, and 3, and differential equations.  <a href="/teaching/">Read more about my teaching experience</a>.</p>

<h3 id="software-development">Software Development</h3>

<p>I have written lots of software, mainly in Python and C.  You can view my <a href="https://github.com/rsbowman">github page</a> to see some of it.  (Don't get too excited â€“ most people are unlikely to find anything terribly interesting here.)  You can also visit my <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/users/126738/sean-bowman">Kaggle profile</a>.  Kaggle hosts data science competitions, and I have written a bit of custom software (mainly using Python's sklearn package) as part of my entries.</p>
