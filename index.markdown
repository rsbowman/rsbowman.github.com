I am a <a href="/mathematics">Mathematician</a>, <a href="/programming">software
developer</a>, and <a href="/teaching">teacher</a>.  Currently I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.okstate.edu/">Oklahoma State University</a>.

### Mathematics

I got my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in May 2012 under the supervision of John Luecke.   I am currently working on several projects

* giving bounds on the bridge numbers of certain families of knots,
* constructing knots with prescribed bridge numbers and interesting Dehn surgeries, and
* examining the relationship between the bridge numbers of a knot and properties of the knot exterior, such as its Heegaard structure. 

In addition to these topics, I am also interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological
data analysis</a>.

### Software Development

I have written lots of software, mainly in Python and C.  <a href="/programming">Some of it appears here</a>.

### Teaching

For much of the past decade I have been involved in teaching at the college level.  Classes I've taught include college algebra, precalculus, calculus 1, 2, and 3, and differential equations.  <a href="/teaching">Read more about my teaching experience</a>.
