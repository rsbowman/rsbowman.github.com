I am a <a href="/mathematics">Mathematician</a>, <a href="/programming">software
developer</a>, and <a href="/teaching">teacher</a>.  Currently I'm finishing up
my Ph.D. in Mathematics at UT, Austin.

### Ph.D. Work

My Ph.D. thesis deals with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_surgery">Dehn surgery</a> on knots in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handlebody">handlebodies</a>.  I have constructed several infinite families of knots which have surgeries again yielding handlebodies.  Such knots were thought to be relatively simple in terms of an invariant called bridge number, but my examples disprove this conjecture. <a href="/mathematics">Read more about my work in mathematics</a>.

### Software Development

I have written lots of software, mainly in Python and C.  <a href="/programming">Some of it appears here</a>.

### Teaching

For much of the past decade I have been involved in teaching at the college level.  Classes I've taught include college algebra, precalculus, calculus 1, 2, and 3, and differential equations.  <a href="/teaching">Read more about my teaching experience</a>.
