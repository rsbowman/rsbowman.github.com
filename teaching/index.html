<p>I have taught math classes ranging from college algebra to
differential equations; a full list is given below.  My teaching
philosophy involves lots of student contact, frequent low risk
assessment opportunities, and feedback between student and teacher.</p>

<p>At Oklahoma State University, I have been part of the overhaul of the
Calculus I course at OSU, an effort to improve the student success
rates significantly.  During my time there I have taught Calculus I
as well as Differential Equations/Linear Algebra.</p>

<p>During the period 2005â€“2011 at UT Austin, I taught calculus for the
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/lsp">Longhorn Scholars</a> program for three
semesters.  These classes include first generation and historically
underrepresented students who sometimes need extra help adjusting to
college life.  These classes are challenging, but also rewarding, to
teach.</p>

<p>Rewarding in a different way are classes for honors students.  I
taught one semester of honors differential equations, and I was
invited to teach calculus for emerging scholars for two semesters.
This class, in which students can enroll by invitation only, is a
challenging adjunct to the traditional calculus sequence.</p>

<p>Here is a more or less complete list of classes I have taught:</p>

<ul>
  <li>college algebra</li>
  <li>discrete math</li>
  <li>precalculus</li>
  <li>calculus I, II, and III,</li>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>linear algebra</li>
  <li>calculus for emerging scholars (a challenging adjunct to the traditional calculus sequence) </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to undergraduate teaching, I have also had many
opportunities to speak about mathematics in general and my work in
particular.  My <a href="/publications/">publications and talks</a> page has a complete list.</p>
