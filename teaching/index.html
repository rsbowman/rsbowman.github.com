<p>I have taught math classes ranging from college algebra to
differential equations; a full list is given below.  My teaching
philosophy involves lots of student contact, frequent low risk
assessment opportunities, and feedback between student and teacher.
You can <a href="/documents/teaching-statement.pdf">read my teaching statement
here</a>.</p>

<p>During the period 2005â€“2011, I taught calculus for the Longhorn
Scholars program for three semesters.  These classes include first
generation and historically underrepresented students who sometimes
need extra help adjusting to college life.  These classes are
challenging, but also rewarding, to teach.</p>

<p>Rewarding in a different way are classes for honors students.  I
taught one semester of honors differential equations, and I was
invited to teach calculus for emerging scholars for two semesters.
This class, in which students can enroll by invitation only, is a
challenging adjunct to the traditional calculus sequence.</p>

<p>Here is a more or less complete list of classes I have taught:</p>

<ul>
  <li>college algebra</li>
  <li>discrete math</li>
  <li>precalculus</li>
  <li>calculus I, II, and III,</li>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>calculus for emerging scholars (a challenging adjunct to the traditional calculus sequence) </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to undergraduate teaching, I have also had many
opportunities to speak about mathematics in general and my work in
particular.  My <a href="/publications/">publications and talks</a> page has a complete list.</p>
