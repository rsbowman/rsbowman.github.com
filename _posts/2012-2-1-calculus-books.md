In February 2012 I published a book on [Sequences and
Series in Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Sequences-Problems-Solutions-ebook/dp/B0071Q2P90)
for Amazon Kindle devices.  You can read it on a Kindle as well as
PC/Mac/iPhone/iPad/Android devices.  One of my goals for the project
was to make the math look pretty.  This turned out to be very
difficult to do!  The book is written in
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).  In order to render it to a
format usable by the Kindle, I used a modified version of
[plasTeX](http://plastex.sourceforge.net/), [Calibre ebook
reader](http://calibre-ebook.com/), and custom software.
