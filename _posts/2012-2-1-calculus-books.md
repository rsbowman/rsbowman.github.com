I have published two calculus books for Amazon Kindle devices:

* [Calculus Sequences and Series: Problems and Solutions](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Sequences-Problems-Solutions-ebook/dp/B0071Q2P90) and
* [Calculus Limits: Problems and Solutions](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Limits-Problems-Solutions-ebook/dp/B00850JO1S)

You can read them on a Kindle as well as PC/Mac/iPhone/iPad/Android
devices.  One of my goals for the project was to make the math look
pretty.  This turned out to be very difficult to do!  The books are
written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).  In order to render
them to a format usable by the Kindle, I used a modified version of
[plasTeX](http://plastex.sourceforge.net/), [Calibre ebook
reader](http://calibre-ebook.com/), and custom software.
