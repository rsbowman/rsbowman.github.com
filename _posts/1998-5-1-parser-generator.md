title: A Parser Generator in Python
categories:

In 1998 I was a bored college student with a lot of homework to put off doing.  To entertain
myself, I wrote a simple parser generator in Python.  It takes a LL(1) grammar and outputs
a python file to parse the grammar.  Of course, the parser generator can be used to generate itself by
giving it a specification of its own input language.  This still blows my mind.
