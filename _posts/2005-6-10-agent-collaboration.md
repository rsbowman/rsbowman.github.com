The field of multi-agent systems studies how individual agents can
collaborate to solve problems or model a phenomenon.  In our paper
*Agent Collaboration and Social Networks*, Henry Hexmoor and I
investigate a simple scenario where a group of robots need to push
boxes to certain spots on a grid.  We managed to show some pretty
boring things: for example, when the robots work together, they can
get all the boxes to their correct spots faster.  (Duh.)  But there
are some more difficult, subtle problems that our work sheds light on.
For example, if a robot is trying to maximize their own number of
boxes pushed, whether or not they join a group might depend on such
factors as the size of the group relative to the total number of
robots.
