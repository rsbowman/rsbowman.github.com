Particle accelerators such as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">Large Hadron
Collider</a> at CERN need to sift through trillions of "events" in
order to record interesting ones.  Later, more specialized programs
are used to search for traces of particles such as the Higgs boson.
Neural network techniques have traditionally been used for this, but
in 2004 my colleague Kyle Cranmer and I published a paper entitled <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0402030">PhysicsGP: A Genetic
Programming Approach to Event Selection</a> in which we used genetic
programming techniques to achieve results on par with the currently
used ones.  The code was written in Python and C.
