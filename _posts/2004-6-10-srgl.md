In 2004 my colleague Stephen McCaul and I wrote software for high
school students to explore <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems</a> during a
summer math program.  This software implemented a language called the
"Simple Recursive Graphics Language" and rendered L-systems using
OpenGL.  An example of a bush (different from the one shown) in SRGL:

    (= (+) (turn 25))
    (= (-) (turn -25))
    (= ([) (push))
    (= (]) (pop))
    (= (F) (draw 1))
    (turn 90)
    (lsystem F "FF+[+F-F-F]-[-F+F+F]")
    (F 4)
